The symbolic level is not doing its job
I do not see well what is happening
Sorry, I drink a glass of water
Maybe I should clean my glasses
Video processing is not doing its job
The action is not very clear
From our perspective it is difficult to understand what is happening
Perhaps the recordings will make us understand more clearly
