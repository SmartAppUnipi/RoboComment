## Usage
Run `./setup` to download YOLO weights (optional parameter `yolo320` makes it so you can download the lighter version).

Run `data/videos/download.sh` from bash shell to get some `.mp4` clips for testing.

Also make sure to have the index file downloaded in `data` directory through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZvZU8r5MxxMb42wniA1eb2v4txtjmNoo/view?usp=sharing).


## Yolo module
Yolo module contains two main functionalities the yolo network itself and a cache that can be used to speedup development phase on laptops.
### Yolo Network
Yolo network is implemented in pytorch (to efficiently use the GPU) using a sliding window to take advantage of the full image resolution. Yolo config and weights can be downloaed by running the script `yolo/models/download.sh`.
The model can be used as follows:
```python
from libs.yolo.yolo import get_device, Yolo

# read the model and move it to the GPU (if available)
device = get_device()
yolo = Yolo("yolo/models/yolov3.cfg", device)

# get a frame with opencv
# img = ...

predictions = yolo.predict(img)
```
`predictions` is a 2D numpy array where each row contains: x, y, w, h, object_score, class_score, class_id.

ATTENTION! NMS should be applied to predictions.

### Yolo Cache
Sample usage:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('videos/juve_attacking.mp4')
cache = YoloCache('videos/juve_attacking_cache.npz')

for i in range(10):
    _, img = cap.read()
    predictions = cache.predict(img)
```
`predictions` are same as above.

ATTENTION! `cache.predict` doesn't take into consideration the input, it just returns the next cached prediction.

## Sample Videos
Yolo caches for a few sample videos are included in the repository. To download the corresponding videos run `videos/download.sh`

## Pose

Usage:
```python
from libs.pose import PoseDetector
pose = posedetector.getpose(box=referee_box)
```
returns referee pose as string
